GOOD READS CREATIVE BRIEF DISCOVERY

Company background: Goodreads is the worldâ€™s largest site for readers and book recommendations. Goodreads is an Amazon company and "social cataloging" website. Our mission is to help people find and share books they love. Goodreads launched in January 2007. Recommendation engine analyzes 20 billion data points to give suggestions tailored to your literary tastes. We started in my living room, motivated by the belief that there was a better way to discover and discuss good books, and that we could build it. Goodreads is that site. It is a place where you can see what your friends are reading and vice versa. You can create "bookshelves" to organize what you've read (or want to read). You can comment on each other's reviews. You can find your next favorite book. And on this journey with your friends you can explore new territory, gather information, and expand your mind.

"Knowledge is power, and power is best shared among readers."

GR Users/target audience: 55 million members 50 million reviews

Bookshelf Purpose: pros: can track what you have read organizes the books you want to read and could potentially forget the title to by the time you get around to reading it can see overall ratings of books can rate books you have read to better shape your recommendations

cons:
      too many funcitons for the average person, ironically, we do not want to read that much content. 
      visually cluttered
      difficult to track people/authors/reviewers
      needs to be simplified
Aesthetics:

boring
cluttered, too much type and information on one single page
needs more visual draws to zero people in on certain aspects and encourage a user "flow" to the site
type can easily be converted to visual icons/indicators
Functionality:

the vocabulary chosen for certain links/commands isn't intuitive.
has an option to look at "my books" in a grid visual option, but you have to click a very tiny link for that option and the images come with no further information.
sidebar options are too vast and don't hint at the purpose of what an "export" option would be on a book recommendation site.
"currently reading" function is kind of unnecessary. Unless you have an active group of reading friends who consistently track their friend's activities on GR, then it seem redundant because the reader already knows what they are currently reading.
It doesn't seem user friendly for the average person, maybe its indepth commands and functions are attractive/useful to the authors and major site contributors, however for the every day person who just want recommendations and to create a book queue, it does not seem nearly efficient enough.
GOAL: to visually simplify the aesthetics and commands. The average user wants to use basic functions, and not "deep dive" into the many range of functions that dont seem to be generally useful. Create a more visual heavy, intuitive, design that encourages user flow and efficiency.
